<h1 id="ides">IDEs</h1>

<p>There are several IDEs available for Lua on OS X. Since this is not a business that generates income I wanted a free, or at least low cost, IDE. I initially tried ZeroBrane which seemed to be a good IDE except that it didn’t have the (Emacs) cursor motion/selection keybindings I am use to. So why don’t I use Emacs? Emacs is a fantastic program but it is not really an editor, or an IDE. It is a lisp programming and execution environment that is frequently used as an editor. Many people use it productively but configuring it seems to be a black art that results in near infinite “bit twiddling”.</p>

<p>Next I tried my goto editor Sublime Text. It is already good at editing files so I added three packages.</p>

<ol>
  <li>REPLSublime - Runs a REPL for a selected language in a ST window.</li>
  <li>Autocomplete - What the name says.</li>
  <li>LuaExtended - Better syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>MonokaiExtended - Prettier syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>sublemacspro - Makes ST more Emacs awesome.</li>
  <li>OrigamiEmacs - Better window control.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far I am quite pleased with the results.</p>
